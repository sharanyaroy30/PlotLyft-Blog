  <h2>June 2024 — Teaching Code in Brownsville, NY</h2>
  <div class="date">2024-06-15</div>
  <p>
    The very first chapter of <strong>PlotLyft</strong> began far from any computer lab — in a vibrant classroom in <strong>Brownsville, NY</strong>.
    That summer, I launched a series of coding and computation workshops to empower local students with the tools to understand and reshape the data around them.
  </p>

  <p>
    Each week, we focused on a new theme — from algorithmic thinking to data visualization — connecting code with real-world community questions.
    Students surveyed local residents about grocery shopping habits, environmental concerns, and neighborhood health resources.
  </p>

  <p>
    Using Python, they learned to clean, count, and summarize their results. One exercise asked them to analyze survey data about which grocery stores Brownsville residents visited most often.
  </p>

  <pre><code class="language-python">
# Community data workshop — Grocery store analysis
from collections import Counter

survey_responses = [
    "Brownsville Market", "GreenMart", "Brownsville Market",
    "FreshChoice", "GreenMart", "UrbanGrocer", "Brownsville Market"
]

# Count frequency of each store
store_counts = Counter(survey_responses)

# Display formatted results
for store, count in store_counts.items():
    print(f"{store:20} | {'█' * count} ({count})")
  </code></pre>

  <p>
    Watching students transform raw survey data into readable patterns was a turning point.
    It showed how <strong>code can visualize collective behavior</strong> — and how data literacy can empower a community.
    This moment marked the true beginning of <strong>PlotLyft</strong>, an idea that would soon evolve into a platform for storytelling through data.
